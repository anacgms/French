        <h2>Alternatively, French fries really were French, first sold by street vendors on Paris Pont Neuf in the 1780s. Or they may even be Spanish, since the Spaniards, after all, were the first Europeans to encounter the South American potato. The first written mention seems to have been that of Pedro Cieza de Leon, a teenage conquistador turned historian, who in 1553 published a memoir of his experiences titled The Chronicle of the Incas, or the Seventeen-Year Travel of Pedro Cieza de Leon Throughout the Mighty Kingdom of Peru. In it, he describes the potato, one of the principal foods of the natives, as “a kind of earth nut which, after it is boiled, is as tender as cooked chestnuts.” Brought home to Spain, the Incan potatoes may very well have been served fried—frying in oil was a Spanish culinary tradition—though the end result wouldn’t have looked much like a French fry, since early potatoes were lumpy and no bigger than golf balls.</h2>

        <h3>How to make a french fries?</h3>
        <ul class="second">
            <li>When you go to buy the potato, try to find out if it is the dry type - at the fair, the sellers know exactly how to tell. Wash the potato skins very well under running water, wiping a clean brush.</li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and place in a pan or bowl of water (this prevents the potatoes from oxidizing and darkening in contact with air). After peeling, choose the way you want to cut them: it can be in thick or thin sticks, slices, fries, cubes, etc. The important thing is that the cut is even.</li>
            <li>Put the oil in a high temperature pan and heat it to the walls. Place a matchstick in the oil to find out when it is done. When the toothpick comes up, remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Dry the potatoes on a clean dish towel and place them in the pan with oil. Stir minimizer so they don't stick. Then stop stirring and let it fry. This first step will be ready when the potatoes are soft and tender. The intention is that they just cook.</li>
            <li>Remove the potatoes from the pan with a slotted spoon and place them to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. This step can be done well in advance, to make a second step when a meal is to be served.</li>
            <li>The second step, re-make the pan with the same oil. Use the matchstick to see if the oil is hot. When the toothpick comes up, remove it from the pan and place the potatoes in the pan. Stir minimizer so they don't stick. Stop stirring and let them fry until they are golden brown. This method makes the potatoes very crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside.</li>
            <li>Remove the potatoes from the pan with the help of a slotted spoon and place them to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Season with salt to taste and quickly.</li>
